                            I was honored to host the awards ceremony for an international American-film festival held in China in 2016. About one year later, a Chinese acquaintance and southern China cultural celebrity directed a feature film and needed our services to help him enter the film festival for 2018. As Chinese directors are constantly seeking opportunities to validate their work on the international stage, he expected that working with us would be a push in the right direction.. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We painstakingly worked together with the Chinese director and his team, and successfully submitted the film entry before the entry deadline. Several months passed. The film festival was only weeks away and both myself and the director repeatedly communicated with each other and the film festival organizing committee. As part of the mundane process that leads up to spectacular events such as international film festivals, we had asked the organizers for a final written document confirming our entry’s acceptance into the festival. But so far there was only silence in response.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It was at this point that we had the first clue that something was amiss. I phoned the committee and politely asked for confirmation. Our submission was not listed, neither was there any record of it. And the deadline for film submissions was long past. I was shocked and horrified and livid all at once. Nevertheless, I calmly explained that we had been working with one of the committee’s head members for months on this submission, and there must have been some mistake. As soon as I mentioned the name of the committee member, there was a long sigh on the other end of the line.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I realized that we had been taken for a ride. Unbeknownst to us, the “committee member" that we had been in contact with for months had in the interim been fired for fraud and other devious business practices. I explained our predicament to the organizer, and was transferred to the director of the film festival, who decided to make a huge exception on account of my timely request, and agreed to expedite our submission, as long as we turned it in on the next business day. I hung up the call with the director in the States and proceeded immediately to explain the situation to the film's director and coordinate efforts on the China side to turn in the film within the next day. The race against the clock paid off, and the submission arrived in time for screening by the organizing committee. 
                            <br />

                            At this point, I was already thanking my lucky stars, but I knew we weren't out of the woods yet. After all, the film had not been officially accepted into the festival. A day after our submission was delivered to the film festival committee, the film's director called me requesting that I communicate with the festival director and use my “close relationship” with him to put in a good word for the film, in hopes of getting an award of some sort. For Americans who don't understand Chinese culture, this request would almost certainly sound absurd and even offensive. The selection process for awards at well-known international film festivals is (supposed to be) fair and unaffected by personal relationships. Any attempt to circumvent that fair process would be frowned upon at best, and at worst, could jeopardize the submission of the film all together.  And we were already treading on thin ice with our late submission.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I did not promise the director anything over the phone. Rather, I waited until the next day when I had a chance to speak with him in person. I explained that we were very lucky that our submission had made it in time, and at this point the final result was out of the control of even the director of the film festival himself, as the decisions regarding awards were made by a panel of judges, and not one person. The director understood my point: Things are done differently in the United States, and we had already done as much as we possibly could on his behalf in pushing the film through to the panel. We would have to leave the rest up to the panel’s decision-making process. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            There are two points worthy of note here:  (1) To begin with, I had no "close relationship" with the director of the film festival. In fact, I had not communicated with him about the film previous to my call reporting foul play. The reason the director decided to help was purely out of respect for the rule of law and the firm conviction that the "right and fair thing" should be done in giving our film a chance. Furthermore, the director of the festival knew that I possibly had evidence against the former member of his team who he was preparing to sue for international fraud. Therefore he agreed to make an exception to the rules and allow our submission.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            But when I explained this situation to the film’s director, he interpreted it to mean that I had a special relationship with the film festival director. I did not attempt to deny that, as that would automatically create a lack of trust in my ability to "work things out" for my client, the film director. Therefore, while candor is important, it is also important to choose the right time for candor. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            (2) When it came to explaining why I could not influence the outcome of the awards process, it was important to disconnect my assumed "close relationship" with the film festival director from the specific issues at hand. If I were to follow the Chinese logic of the film’s director and agree to use my personal "connection" to effect a positive award outcome, eventually it would become evident that I had indeed not done so, and in the end my reputation with both sides would have been seriously damaged. Therefore I took the direct route of explaining the American way of choosing awards. Thus, I neither offended my Chinese client, the director, nor risked jeopardizing his submission with the film festival committee by "doing the Chinese thing" and asking for special treatment from the festival director. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            To this day, the film director believes that I effectively used my "good connections" to affect a good result for his film, which, in the end did win a notable award.  In fact it was playing by the rules and fighting for the "right", all in the context of cultural expertise and sensitivity, that won the day.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The Chinese director later jokingly told me, “Getting this film to the festival had more harrowing twists and turns than the movie plot itself. Thank you for making it work in the end!”
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If only he knew the whole story.
